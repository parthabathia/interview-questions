### Data Structures and Algorithms:

Certainly! Here are answers to the questions:

1. **Implement a binary search algorithm:**
   ```python
   def binary_search(arr, target):
       low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
       while low <= high:
           mid = (low + high) // 2
           if arr[mid] == target:
               return mid
           elif arr[mid] < target:
               low = mid + 1
           else:
               high = mid - 1
       return -1
   ```

2. **Explain how a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm works:**
   DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It starts at the root, explores each adjacent node in turn, and continues until it reaches a leaf node. Then, it backtracks to the nearest node with an unexplored neighbor.

3. **Discuss the differences between breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS):**
   - BFS explores level by level, while DFS explores as far as possible before backtracking.
   - BFS uses a queue data structure, while DFS uses a stack (or recursion).
   - BFS guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted graph, while DFS doesn't necessarily do so.

4. **Implement a basic sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort):**
   ```python
   # Example: Quicksort
   def quicksort(arr):
       if len(arr) <= 1:
           return arr
       pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
       left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
       middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
       right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
       return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)
   ```

5. **How do hash collisions occur, and how can they be resolved?:**
   - Hash collisions occur when two different inputs produce the same hash value.
   - Resolution methods include chaining (using linked lists to store colliding values) or open addressing (probing to find the next available slot).

6. **Solve the "Two Sum" problem using various approaches:**
   ```python
   # Example: Using a hash map
   def two_sum(nums, target):
       num_dict = {}
       for i, num in enumerate(nums):
           complement = target - num
           if complement in num_dict:
               return [num_dict[complement], i]
           num_dict[num] = i
       return None
   ```

7. **Discuss the concept of dynamic programming and provide an example:**
   - Dynamic programming breaks a problem into smaller subproblems and solves each subproblem only once, storing the solutions to subproblems to avoid redundant computations.
   - Example: Fibonacci sequence using dynamic programming (memoization):
     ```python
     memo = {}
     def fib(n):
         if n <= 1:
             return n
         if n not in memo:
             memo[n] = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
         return memo[n]
     ```

8. **Implement a basic graph representation (e.g., adjacency list or adjacency matrix):**
   ```python
   # Example: Adjacency List
   graph = {
       'A': ['B', 'C'],
       'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
       'C': ['A', 'F', 'G'],
       'D': ['B'],
       'E': ['B'],
       'F': ['C'],
       'G': ['C']
   }
   ```

9. **What is the difference between a greedy algorithm and a dynamic programming algorithm?:**
   - Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum, without considering the overall problem.
   - Dynamic programming breaks down a problem into smaller subproblems and solves each subproblem only once, using the solutions to subproblems to solve the overall problem.

10. **Solve the "Longest Common Subsequence" problem:**
    ```python
    def longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2):
        m, n = len(str1), len(str2)
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

        return dp[m][n]
    ```
These are simplified examples, and actual implementations may vary based on specific requirements and programming languages used.
