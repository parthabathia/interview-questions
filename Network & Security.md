### Network and Security:

1. **Explain the concept of TCP/IP and its layers:**
   - TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a suite of communication protocols used for networking. It consists of four layers: Application, Transport, Internet, and Link. Each layer has specific functions, facilitating reliable and standardized communication across networks.

2. **How does SSL/TLS work, and why is it important for secure communication:**
   - SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols that ensure secure data transmission over a network. They establish a secure connection through encryption, data integrity, and authentication, preventing eavesdropping and tampering. This is crucial for protecting sensitive information during online transactions and data transfers.

3. **Discuss common security vulnerabilities in web applications and how to mitigate them:**
   - Common vulnerabilities include SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and insecure direct object references. Mitigation strategies involve input validation, parameterized queries, using secure coding practices, employing web application firewalls, and regular security audits.

4. **Explain the differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption:**
   - Symmetric encryption uses a single key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric encryption uses a pair of public and private keys. Symmetric is faster but requires secure key exchange, while asymmetric provides secure key exchange but is computationally intensive.

5. **How would you design a secure API for a mobile application:**
   - Secure API design involves using HTTPS, enforcing authentication (OAuth, API keys), validating input data, employing rate limiting, encrypting sensitive data in transit and at rest, and keeping APIs versioned. Regular security audits and monitoring for abnormal behavior are also essential.

6. **Discuss the role of firewalls in network security:**
   - Firewalls act as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic. They help prevent unauthorized access, monitor and filter network activity based on pre-established security rules, and protect against various cyber threats.

7. **Explain the principles of zero-trust security architecture:**
   - Zero-trust assumes no inherent trust in devices, users, or systems, regardless of their location. It enforces strict access controls, continuous verification, and least privilege principles. Every user and device, even those within the network perimeter, must be authenticated and authorized before accessing resources.

8. **What is a DDoS attack, and how can it be prevented or mitigated:**
   - A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack overwhelms a system, service, or network with a flood of traffic, rendering it unavailable. Prevention and mitigation involve using firewalls, load balancers, content delivery networks (CDNs), and specialized DDoS protection services to filter and absorb malicious traffic.

9. **Discuss the importance of input validation in preventing security vulnerabilities:**
   - Input validation ensures that user input adheres to expected formats and constraints. Proper validation prevents common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting by rejecting or sanitizing malicious input. It is a crucial defense mechanism against various security threats.

10. **How do you ensure data privacy and compliance with regulations in a software system:**
    - Ensuring data privacy involves implementing encryption for data in transit and at rest, enforcing access controls, conducting regular security audits, and adhering to relevant data protection regulations (such as GDPR or HIPAA). Compliance requires staying informed about legal requirements and integrating them into the system's design and practices.
