### General Technical Questions:

Certainly! Here are answers to the questions:

1. **Difference between Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming:**
   - Procedural Programming focuses on procedures or routines that perform operations on data, often using functions. It follows a linear flow of execution.
   - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) organizes code into objects, which encapsulate data and behavior. It emphasizes concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

2. **Polymorphism and its Implementation:**
   - Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. It can be achieved through method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) and method overriding (runtime polymorphism) in languages like Java and C++.

3. **Principles of SOLID in Software Design:**
   - SOLID is an acronym representing five design principles:
     - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
     - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
     - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
     - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
     - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
   - These principles aim to improve code maintainability, flexibility, and scalability.

4. **Multithreading vs. Multiprocessing:**
   - Multithreading involves multiple threads in a single process, sharing the same resources, but executing independently.
   - Multiprocessing involves multiple processes, each with its own resources and memory space.
   - Multithreading is more lightweight and allows for efficient communication between threads, while multiprocessing provides better isolation.

5. **Garbage Collection in Java and C#:**
   - Garbage collection automatically reclaims memory occupied by objects no longer in use.
   - In Java, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) uses garbage collection algorithms (e.g., generational garbage collection).
   - In C#, the Common Language Runtime (CLR) performs garbage collection using a similar approach.

6. **Difference between Stack and Queue:**
   - Stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, where the last element added is the first to be removed.
   - Queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure, where the first element added is the first to be removed.
   - Use a stack for tasks like tracking function calls or managing undo operations. Use a queue for tasks like managing print jobs or handling requests in a web server.

7. **Differences between Linked List and Array:**
   - A linked list is a dynamic data structure where elements are linked using pointers, allowing for efficient insertions and deletions.
   - An array is a static data structure with a fixed size, providing fast random access.
   - Use a linked list when frequent insertions/deletions are required. Use an array when fast access to elements by index is crucial.

8. **Virtual Memory and its Importance:**
   - Virtual memory allows a computer to execute programs larger than its physical memory by using disk space as an extension.
   - It provides a convenient abstraction for processes, allowing them to have the illusion of dedicated memory.
   - Virtual memory enables efficient multitasking and better resource utilization.

9. **Big O Notation and Algorithm Complexity:**
   - Big O notation expresses the upper bound of an algorithm's time or space complexity in the worst-case scenario.
   - It helps analyze and compare the efficiency of algorithms as input size grows.
   - Common complexities include O(1) for constant time, O(log n) for logarithmic, O(n) for linear, O(n^2) for quadratic, etc.

10. **How Hash Table Works and its Advantages/Disadvantages:**
    - A hash table uses a hash function to map keys to indices in an array, allowing for efficient key-value pair retrieval.
    - Advantages: Fast lookup time (O(1) on average), efficient for associative arrays.
    - Disadvantages: Risk of collisions (resolved through techniques like chaining or open addressing), may require dynamic resizing.
