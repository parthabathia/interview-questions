### System Design:

1. **Design a URL shortening service like Bitly:**
   - Use a distributed key-value store for storing mappings between short and long URLs.
   - Generate unique short keys using an algorithm or a hash function.
   - Include features like custom aliases, expiration times, and analytics.

2. **Explain the principles of load balancing and how they apply to distributed systems:**
   - Load balancing involves distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers.
   - Ensures no single server bears too much load, improving performance and fault tolerance.
   - Algorithms include round-robin, least connections, and least response time.

3. **Design a scalable and fault-tolerant distributed cache:**
   - Use consistent hashing for distributing data across cache nodes.
   - Implement data partitioning and replication for fault tolerance.
   - Use a distributed consensus protocol (e.g., Raft) for cache consistency.

4. **How would you design a distributed file system:**
   - Divide files into chunks and distribute them across multiple servers.
   - Use a master server for metadata management, such as file location and access control.
   - Implement replication for fault tolerance and consistency.

5. **Discuss the pros and cons of microservices architecture:**
   - *Pros:* Scalability, technology flexibility, independent deployment.
   - *Cons:* Increased complexity, potential communication overhead, and challenges in data consistency.

6. **Design a recommendation system for a streaming platform:**
   - Use collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches.
   - Consider real-time user behavior and preferences for dynamic recommendations.
   - Utilize machine learning models to improve recommendation accuracy.

7. **How would you design a scalable and efficient logging system:**
   - Use distributed log storage (e.g., Kafka) for real-time log processing.
   - Implement log rotation and compression for efficient storage.
   - Use structured logging for easy querying and analysis.

8. **Discuss the CAP theorem and its implications for distributed systems:**
   - CAP theorem states that a distributed system can have at most two out of three: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.
   - Implications: In the face of network partitions, a system must choose between consistency and availability.

9. **Design a real-time chat application:**
   - Use WebSockets for real-time communication.
   - Implement message queues for handling message persistence and delivery.
   - Ensure end-to-end encryption for security.

10. **Explain the concept of eventual consistency in distributed databases:**
    - Eventual consistency allows distributed replicas to become consistent over time.
    - Systems prioritize availability and partition tolerance over immediate consistency.
    - Requires conflict resolution mechanisms and may lead to temporary inconsistencies.

These answers provide a high-level overview. In an interview setting, it's essential to go into more detail and address specific aspects of the design or concepts.
